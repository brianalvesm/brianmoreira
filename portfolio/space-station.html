									<h1 class="page-title">Space Station</h1>
									<p>This wacky illustration was designed to be the background for the frontpage of my website — So don’t mind the weird empty spaces, that’s where the text and links were going to be! The idea was eventually scrapped. But since the work done was just getting dust in a drawer, I figure I could at least present it.</p>

									<p>Little aliens appear around the illustration, including a mysterious one, hiding behind the station’s entrance. It was also going to feature a little Space Jam easter-egg of the Moron Mountain, which I meant to be clickable and a nice little surprise for visitors. This is something I actually done before in previous versions of my website, so the Moron Mountain illustration was already finished and I could just place it here.</p>

											<h2>Development</h2>
											<p>Right there you can see the line art. I drew this on paper and scanned it to paint digitally, which I have been doing in some of my work for a while and really enjoying it.</p>
											<p>I’ve said this before, Looney Tunes are a great inspiration for me. So as you can see, that big funny arrow sign is very reminiscent of what they used to do in cartoons set in space.</p>
